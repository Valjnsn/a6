Summers (May through October) feature with hot temperatures, intense sun, and frequent (daily) thundershowers that build in the daytime heat. High temperatures are typically in the upper 80s to low 90s. The city's coastal location prevents temperatures from becoming very hot, though heat indices are often over 100 °F (38 °C). There are 76 days of 90+ °F highs annually. On average, 96 °F (36 °C) is the highest temperature recorded each summer. Late summer brings an increased threat of tropical storms and hurricanes, though landfalls are rare. Several major hurricanes have impacted Stuart since 1900, with Hurricane David in 1979 and hurricanes Frances and Jeanne caused moderate damage to the area in 2004

<p>Winter (November through April) or the dry season brings much cooler and drier air masses, and humidity and dew points fall considerably. Winters can become quite dry, and by late winter (March) there is often high fire danger and even residential water use restriction. Average daytime highs in the winter/dry season are from 73 °F (23 °C) to 77 °F (25 °C), though occasional strong cold fronts bring brief rainfall followed by cooler temperatures, with highs in the 50s °F for a few days each winter. Low temperatures fall rarely fall below 40 °F (4 °C), and most winters are frost-free. The first cold front of the season usually occurs in October or November, when the first low below 60 °F (16 °C) usually occurs. Though weather during this time is generally more mild, mid winter highs can still hit 80 °F (27 °C) or higher on occasion.</p>
